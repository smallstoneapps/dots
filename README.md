### Pebble Watchface 'Dots'

This is a simple custom watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch][1] using dots to display the current time.

#### Install

You can install this watchface by clicking [this link][3] on the Android or iOS device that you have paired to your Pebble watch.
There is also an inverted version of the watchface (black dots on white background) which can be installed [from here][4].
